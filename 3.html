  <h2> What is JavaScript? </h2>

  <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="wekipedia" id="JavaScript">JavaScript</a>
     often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the
     ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax,
     dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
     <br>
     Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
     <br>
     JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. 
     <br> 
     The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
     <br>
     As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
     <br>
     It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
     and the Document Object Model (DOM). 
     <br> 
     However, the language itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.
     JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some servers,
     usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.</p>
