  <h2> WEB이란 무엇인가? </h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank" title="wikipedia">The World Wide Web (WWW)</a>,
    commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by
    Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext,
    and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the WWW are
    transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and may be accessed by users by a software application called
    a web browser and are published by a software application called a web server.
